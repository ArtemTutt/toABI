# toABI
This project is designed to simplify working with Hardhat.


** Description ** 
This project is designed to simplify working with Hardhat. It provides a script that extracts the API (application Programming interface) from the Hardhat artifact and moves it to the specified folder. This can be useful for organizing and accessing the ABI in other projects or for preparing for the deployment of smart contracts.

** Using ** 
Run the script with the command:
node toAbi.js
